# Predicting Wine Rating

### The Data and Goal

<b>Source</b> - The data that I have worked on within this project comes from Kaggle. You can find the data if you follow below link: <br>https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

<b>Background</b> - The original idea behind the collection of the data was to find a way to predict what type of wine it is based on a description and review. I have in this project taken a different challenge and that is the one of predicting the wine rating based on the information we have about the specific wines in the dataset.

<b>Questions to answer</b>:
1. What are the top 5 countries with the best overall average wine rating
2. Is there a relationship between price and how good a wine is (rating)
3. Can we predict the rating based on the data we have about the different wines
